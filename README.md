# TicTacToe Ultimate
I did an [assignment](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AI3411) on this topic so why not?

Planning to make it with Flutter with the potential to port it anywhere (with the new preview of flutter web and desktop) and have normal tic-tac-toe and ultimate version + single player and multiplay mode maybe. For single player, you can choose difficulties of the bot (from easy to impossible). ~~Optional ads~~ Maybe show ads if you lose or draw. Banner is also good if it does not take up lots of spaces.
It has been a while since I made a game (in 2014, [SuuBird](https://github.com/0xsuu/SuuBird) clone which is a Flappy Bird clone).
